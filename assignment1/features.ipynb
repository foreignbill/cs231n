In this exercise we will show that we can improve our classification performance by training linear classifiers not on raw pixels but on features that are computed from the raw pixels.\n\nAll of your work for this exercise will be done in this notebook.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00000-db70aaa8-9c77-4461-a992-bc22db4a7e2e","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"cell_id":"00001-a8ee7a9c-cf53-48b4-9f32-dd9631b49ede","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import random\nimport numpy as np\nfrom cs231n.data_utils import load_CIFAR10\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom __future__ import print_function\n\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10.0, 8.0) # set default size of plots\nplt.rcParams['image.interpolation'] = 'nearest'\nplt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'gray'\n\n# for auto-reloading extenrnal modules\n# see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1907993/autoreload-of-modules-in-ipython\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load data\nSimilar to previous exercises, we will load CIFAR-10 data from disk.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-1fd6fcf6-18d3-48c4-a649-33e5953787cd","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"cell_id":"00003-6ab57aed-bc65-4bcf-831f-1917852b9832","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"from cs231n.features import color_histogram_hsv, hog_feature\n\ndef get_CIFAR10_data(num_training=49000, num_validation=1000, num_test=1000):\n    # Load the raw CIFAR-10 data\n    cifar10_dir = 'cs231n/datasets/cifar-10-batches-py'\n    X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = load_CIFAR10(cifar10_dir)\n    \n    # Subsample the data\n    mask = list(range(num_training, num_training + num_validation))\n    X_val = X_train[mask]\n    y_val = y_train[mask]\n    mask = list(range(num_training))\n    X_train = X_train[mask]\n    y_train = y_train[mask]\n    mask = list(range(num_test))\n    X_test = X_test[mask]\n    y_test = y_test[mask]\n    \n    return X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test\n\nX_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test = get_CIFAR10_data()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Extract Features\nFor each image we will compute a Histogram of Oriented\nGradients (HOG) as well as a color histogram using the hue channel in HSV\ncolor space.
